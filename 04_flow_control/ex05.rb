# When you run the following code...

def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
end

equal_to_four(5)

# You get the following message...
# exercise.rb:8: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting keyword_end

# Why do you get this error and how can you fix it?

# Answer: You get this error because the if statement does not have an end. To fix it, simply insert an end above the existing end, and indent it two spaces.

# Corrected code below:
def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
  end
end

equal_to_four(5)
